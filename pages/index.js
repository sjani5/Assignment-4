            The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, colloquially
            &quot;the Met &quot;, is the largest art museum in the Americas. Its
            permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among
            17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue,
            along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park on
            Manhattan &apos;s Upper East Side, is by area one of the
            world&apos;s largest art museums. The first portion of the
            approximately 2-million-square-foot (190,000 m2) building was built
            in 1880. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon
            Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art,
            architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.

            The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its mission
            to bring art and art education to the American people. The
            museum&apos;s permanent collection consists of works of art from
            classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures
            from nearly all the European Old Masters, and an extensive
            collection of American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive
            holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art.
            The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical
            instruments, costumes, and accessories, as well as antique weapons
            and armor from around the world. Several notable interiors, ranging
            from 1st-century Rome through modern American design, are installed
            in its galleries.
